# FuseMesh Unity Editor Script
The "FuseMesh" Unity editor script is designed to combine multiple meshes into a single mesh. This can be useful for optimizing performance or simplifying the management of complex scenes in your Unity projects.

## Features
* Combines meshes within a specified GameObject.
* Supports combining meshes with different materials.
* Provides an option to export the resulting mesh as an asset.
## How to Use
* Open the Unity editor.

* To access the FuseMesh window, go to Window -> FuseMesh.

* In the FuseMesh window, you'll find the following options:

**TargetMesh:** Select the GameObject that contains the meshes you want to combine.

**Export Mesh:** Toggle this option if you want to export the resulting mesh as an asset.

**Export Path:** Specify the path where the exported mesh asset will be saved.

* Click the "Combine" button to start the mesh combining process.

## Example Usage
Here's a step-by-step example of how to use the FuseMesh script:

* Open the Unity editor.

* Select the GameObject containing the meshes you want to combine as the "TargetMesh."

* If you want to export the combined mesh, enable the "Export Mesh" option and specify the export path using the "Export Path" field.

* Click the "Combine" button.

* The script will combine the meshes and, if the export option is enabled, save the resulting mesh as an asset in the specified export path.
